# Personal Portfolio

## Description 
A modifiable website to showcase my projects in full stack web development. The website was made using HTML and CSS, though some added javascript functionality will be included later. 

The website can be found [here]().

## Table of Contents

If your README is very long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Usage 

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed. 

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README.
